Final Project

These are the python codes that simulate the wealth (or surplus) of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) based on public information given on FEMA.gov and basic assumptions of investment practice.

The directory 'Large event' contains model that includes the possibility of a rare, large calamity happening and the help of reinsurance coverage, which NFIP has assimilated into its financing.

The directory 'No large event' does not assume there is a rare large event and only takes into account historically average claims. 

The primary method used is Monte Carlo simulation, and the model equation was developed by the writers of this code.
